Step 1: Open your command-line and browse to the folder where you extracted the zip file.

Step 2: Once you have a command window up in the folder that the downloaded material was placed, type:

Windows: "gradlew setupDecompWorkspace"
Linux/Mac OS: "./gradlew setupDecompWorkspace"

Step 3: After all that finished, you're left with a choice.
For eclipse, run "gradlew eclipse" (./gradlew eclipse if you are on Mac/Linux)

If you prefer to use IntelliJ, steps are a little different.
1. Open IDEA, and import project.
2. Select your build.gradle file and have it import.
3. Once it's finished you must close IntelliJ and run the following command:

"gradlew genIntellijRuns" (./gradlew genIntellijRuns if you are on Mac/Linux)

Step 4: The final step is to open Eclipse and switch your workspace to /eclipse/ (if you use IDEA, it should automatically start on your project)
